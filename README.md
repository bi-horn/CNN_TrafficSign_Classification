# Convolutional Neural Network for Traffic Sign Classification
## CNN with Tensorflow - Traffic sign classification (43 classes)

Dataset downloaded from: https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/traffic.zip

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consists of convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers tailored for classifying 43 different types of traffic signs.

Run the folloing code in the terminal in the correct file directory: python3.11 traffic.py data_dir [model.h5]

The keras model reaches the following results for the test dataset (10 epochs): loss: 0.1104 - accuracy: 0.9780 - 2s/epoch - 6ms/step
